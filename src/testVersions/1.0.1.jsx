          Mason Plumlee is far from the first to observe that in the digital
          age, "the more information we consume, the less informed we seem to
          be." Yet, in this engaging and thought-provoking book, he convincingly
          argues that this phenomenon is especially evident in the realm of food
          and diet, an area that used to be relatively straightforward. When it
          comes to eating habits, many of us, as one psychology professor
          Plumlee cites, have become strikingly "insensitive to evidence." How
          else can we explain the surge of people without coeliac disease making
          the scientifically baseless choice to avoid gluten? Or the widespread
          influence of health websites peddling dubious claims like "wild
          blueberries remove heavy metals from brain tissue"? Plumlee highlights
          the absurdity of the detox industry, which thrives by rejecting three
          basic facts: the modern world does not expose us to unprecedented
          levels of toxins; a healthy body naturally eliminates toxins in its
          usual unglamorous ways; and no single food, not even blueberries, can
          perform this function for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, though, Plumlee is merely warming up. In subsequent
          chapters, he systematically dismantles a host of food myths with
          scientific precision and a touch of mischievous delight. Take, for
          example, proponents of the Paleo Diet, who claim humans aren’t
          biologically adapted to eat anything beyond what hunter-gatherers once
          consumed—despite the fact that nobody knows exactly what that was. Or
          the baseless fear of sugar, which Plumlee assures us won’t harm us in
          moderation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early on, Plumlee's tone is more measured than furious—though it’s
          easy to see why "The Relatively Measured Chef" might not have been the
          most marketable title. He even remains composed while debunking the
          simplistic "natural versus chemical" dichotomy promoted by self-styled
          wellness gurus, who seem to forget that all of nature is made up of
          chemicals.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the book progresses, however, Plumlee delves deeper into what he
          describes as the "dark heart" of dietary fads. On the surface, faking
          enthusiasm for kale smoothies and quinoa might appear to be harmless,
          if self-indulgent, nonsense. But Plumlee warns these trends can act as
          a "gateway", leading individuals into more dangerous forms of
          credulity.

          It was a lazy Sunday afternoon, the lull before the storm of Monday morning madness of alarm clocks, traffic jams and deadlines. The clock struck three and Rebecca's elbow still rested on the arm of the tapestry-covered sofa. With her fingertips she began caressing the rough piping that ran along its seams. Simultaneously, the toes of her left foot moved back and forth across the edges of the sheepskin rug. This action Rebecca found comforting; it reminded her of being at home as a child when she used to sit in the family sitting room, her toes playing with the fringes of another kind of rug. Her mother would snap at her to stop it, so of course she did it all the more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rebecca had a sudden whiff of the glue that Katy was applying to make one of her artistic creations. Her daughter was seated on a cushion right in the middle of the room, looking like an island, surrounded by a sea of cardboard cut-offs, sequins, felt-tip pens, and pristine sheets of white A4 paper that she had disobediently pinched from her father's study. She really should be working at the kitchen table, Rebecca thought, but I don't have the appetite for the outburst that might happen if my genius-daughter-at-work is disturbed. Every three minutes and 50 seconds Katy got up to replay Kylie Minogue's version of 'The Locomotion'.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why don't you listen to the CD all the way through, Katy?" her dad said, who was sprawled out on the other sofa. "You'd like the other songs as well." "Nah, too boring."
        </p>
        <p>
          Rebecca glanced at David and then said, "I could do with something to perk me up." Her words trailed off with a heavy sigh, and then a yawn. It was the first in a series of hints that she would like him to get up and make her a cup of tea.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the lamp table next to the sofa, she noticed a letter that had been delivered a week ago, advertising exercises classes and a slimming club. She had kept it on the table as a reminder, or perhaps to conjure up the same kind of magical effect that people believe in when they splash out on membership to a fancy gym without going near the place more than once every two months.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Have you seen this flyer?" she said to her husband. "Just the thought of going for a workout makes me want to go and lie down." Once more she didn't get a response. "Who's going to make the tea then?" was her third and most blatant attempt to get a drink before she died of thirst.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stood up. "I suppose it's my turn. Again." He went off into the kitchen while Rebecca, the victor, snuggled a bit further into the sofa. Charlie, who'd been asleep on the sheepskin rug, now started up with his own brand of baby chatter. He was attempting to cover the whole repertoire of vowel sounds this afternoon, like a singer performing warm-up exercises. Then, occasionally, he jammed his fingers into his mouth to make a sound approaching an elongated 'w'.
        </p>
        <p>
          He lay underneath a baby gym, which consisted of a tubular frame in patriotic colours of red, white and blue and a top bar, from which dangled two clowns, one on a swing and one in a position that Rebecca thought was called a pike. (It was a long time ago that she had achieved her gold star award in the trampoline.) Once Charlie made eye contact with Rebecca, his happy babbling began to turn into a grizzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Does Charlie want feeding again?" Rebecca asked in the baby voice that irritated them all, herself included. She bent down to scoop her son up. "Mum, he doesn't want feeding again. You've only just fed him," Katy said. "I'll try - just in case he's hungry." In the kitchen she warmed through the mush of potatoes and broccoli that Charlie liked and took it back through to be with Katy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, the baby was actually ready for a feed, which meant that Rebecca not only saved face with her daughter, but showed that she had no need to feel guilty about sending her husband to make the tea. David walked back in the sitting room that very minute, her cup of Earl Grey with its delicate scent of bergamot wobbling in its saucer. In his other hand he clutched a large mug. Rebecca gave him a warning look that dared him not to put the cups down on the oak blanket box that served as their coffee table. Its surface was already scarred by two rings where hot drinks had been carelessly placed directly onto it.

          "Thanks. You're a treasure." She settled down to feed Charlie, knowing that her tea would be the perfect temperature to drink in one go by the time he had had enough. "Where's Katy got to?" David said, after a few minutes. The answer came from upstairs as they heard the sound of their older child passing through the curtain in the doorway of her bedroom. It was like those beaded curtains that used to be in fashion when Rebecca was a child, but instead of beads this one was formed from a dazzling collection of pink, purple and silver shimmering plastic squares. She couldn't remember which one of them had named it the 'jingle-jangler' but it was very apt.

        propAlternatives={["The recruitment of men to the armed forces during the conflict in Europe from 1914 to 1918 meant there was very little persecution, since gamekeepers went off to fight. As the number of gamekeepers decreased, the wildcat began to increase its range, recolonising many of its former haunts. Extinction was narrowly averted.", "The wildcat waits for a while in rapt concentration, ears twitching and eyes watching, seeing everything and hearing everything, trying to detect the tell-tale movement of a vole or a mouse. But there is nothing, and in another leap he disappears into the gloom.", "The results, which are expected shortly, will be fascinating. But anyone who has seen a wildcat will be in little doubt that there is indeed a unique and distinctive animal living in the Scottish Highlands, whatever his background.", "They probably used deciduous and coniferous woodland for shelter, particularly in winter, and hunted over more open areas such as forest edge, open woodland, thickets and scrub, grassy areas and marsh. The wildcat was probably driven into more mountainous areas by a combination of deforestation and persecution.", "As the animals emerge, their curiosity is aroused by every movement and rustle in the vegetation. Later they will accompany their mother on hunting trips, learning quickly, and soon become adept hunters themselves.", "This is what makes many people think that the wildcat is a species in its own right. Research currently being undertaken by Scottish Natural Heritage is investigating whether the wildcat really is distinct from its home- living cousin, or whether it is nothing more than a wild-living form of the domestic cat.", "It is a typical image most folk have of the beast, but it is very much a false one, for the wildcat is little more than a bigger version of the domestic cat, and probably shows his anger as often"]}

          ['On my living-room wall I have a painting of a wildcat by John Holmes of which I am extremely fond. It depicts a snarling, spitting animal, teeth bared and back arched: a taut coiled spring ready to unleash some unknown fury.'],
          ['', 'drop'],
          ['However, the physical differences are tangible. The wildcat is a much larger animal, weighing in some cases up to seven kilos, the same as a typical male fox. The coat pattern is superficially similar to a domestic tabby cat but it is all stripes and no spots. The tail is thicker and blunter, with three to five black rings. The animal has an altogether heavier look.'],
          ["The Scottish wildcat was originally distinguished as a separate subspecies in 1912, but it is now generally recognised that there is little difference between the Scottish and other European populations. According to an excellent report on the wildcat printed in 1991, the animals originally occurred in a variety of habitats throughout Europe."],
          ['', 'drop'],
          ["It was during the nineteenth century, with the establishment of many estates used by landowners for hunting, that the wildcat became a nuisance and its rapid decline really began; 198 wildcats were killed in three years in the area of Glengarry, for example. However, things were later to improve for the species."],
          ['', 'drop'],
          ["The future is by no means secure, though, and recent evidence suggests that the wildcat is particularly vulnerable to local eradication, especially in the remoter parts of northern and western Scotland. This is a cause for real concern, given that the animals in these areas have less contact with domestic cats and are therefore purer."],
          ['', 'drop'],
          ["Part of the problem stems from the fact that the accepted physical description of the species originates from the selective nature of the examination process by the British Natural History Museum at the start of the century, and this has been used as the type-definition for the animal ever since. Animals that did not conform to that large blunt-tailed 'tabby' description were discarded as not being wildcats. In other words, an artificial collection of specimens was built up, exhibiting the features considered typical of the wildcat."],
          ["The current research aims to resolve this potential problem. It is attempting to find out whether there are any physical features which characterise the so-called wild-living cats."],
          ['', 'drop'],
          ["But what of his lifestyle? Wildcat kittens are usually born in May/June in a secluded den, secreted in a gap amongst boulders. Another favourite location is in the roots of a tree."],
          ['', 'drop'],
          ["Rabbits are a favourite prey, and some of the best areas to see wildcats are at rabbit warrens close to the forest and moorland edge. Mice, small birds and even insects also form a large part of the diet, and the animal may occasionally take young deer."],
          ["The wildcat is one of the Scottish Highlands' most exciting animals. Catch a glimpse of one and the memory will linger forever."]
